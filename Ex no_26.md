# EX 26 C program demonstrating a self-referential structure where an employee has a pointer to their manager.
## AIM:
To write a C program to demonstrate a self-referential structure where an employee has a pointer to their manager.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Create a structure and data member using pointer.
3. Prompt the user to enter a value.
4. Print the structure values.
5. End.
## Program:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
struct Employee {
 int empID;
 char name[50];
 struct Employee *manager; };
int main() {
 struct Employee *emp1, *emp2, *emp3;
 emp1 = (struct Employee*)malloc(sizeof(struct Employee));
 emp2 = (struct Employee*)malloc(sizeof(struct Employee));
 emp3 = (struct Employee*)malloc(sizeof(struct Employee));
 emp1->empID = 1;
 snprintf(emp1->name, sizeof(emp1->name), "John Doe");
 emp1->manager = NULL; 
 emp2->empID = 2;
 snprintf(emp2->name, sizeof(emp2->name), "Alice Smith");
 emp2->manager = emp1; 
 emp3->empID = 3;
 snprintf(emp3->name, sizeof(emp3->name), "Bob Brown");
 emp3->manager = emp1; 
 printf("Employee 1: %s (ID: %d), Manager: %s\n", emp1->name, emp1->empID, (emp1->manager == 
NULL) ? "None" : emp1->manager->name);
 printf("Employee 2: %s (ID: %d), Manager: %s\n", emp2->name, emp2->empID, emp2->manager->name);
 printf("Employee 3: %s (ID: %d), Manager: %s\n", emp3->name, emp3->empID, emp3->manager->name);
 free(emp1);
 free(emp2);
 free(emp3);
 return 0;
}
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program was executed and the output was verified successfully.
